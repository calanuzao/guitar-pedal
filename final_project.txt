Final Project - Due 6:45PM (Beginning of class) on April 30th


Create some digital signal processing system (ie prototype an effect, an analysis system, etc). 
The scope should be at least a bit higher than the plate reverb homework assignment. 
You may use any coding system you like but jupyter notebooks are recommended for their ease of use and
low barrier to working on DSP. Remember, your project should focus on the signal processing;
I don't care if there is any user interface. Your project does not need to be some entirely new invention, 
but don't just 1 to 1 copy a project that already exists. If you have any uncertainties about a project idea, 
run it by me!


Document your project in whatever way makes sense to you (thoroughly annotated jupyter notebook, 
well-organized notes, blog post, video lecture, etc.) The documentation should be aimed at the average 
student beginning this course. Basic knowledge of DSP can be assumed but any theory beyond this should be
explained.

----------------- TO TURN IN -----------------

1. On April 30th you will present your project in class. Give an abbreviated presentation of your

2. Before class on the 30th you will submit your project to brightspace including the following
	- Sourcecode including any dependencies and a readme describing how to run it
	- Documentation of the project as described above
